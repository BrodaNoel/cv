### A bit of my history
I grow up in a really really really little town. Yes, little. Just 800 habitants. Just that. And the closer city of my town is "Cordoba", 320km far away!

When I was 14 years old (year 2004), I started working in a "cyber" (those places where you pay for use a computer). That town, in that year, had NO internet, so, I was there, in the cyber, absolutely bored, looking of people went to the cyber to play some games.

After some months working in that cyber, one day I found a book, a really large (horizontal) book with a "roller coaster" in the front. It said something about "C++ programming" (I never found this book again). I opened it, and I read a couple of pages. That day I asked to the owner of that cyber about that book. He told me something like: "It's to learn programming. I'm sure you'll love it. Try it out when you are bored in your home". I was all day long bored in my home! I had no internet! So there I started testing/trying some nice things. I spend like 3 months to understand how to install and run ["Turbo Borland C++ 3.0"](./borland.png).

Due to in ~2000 (~10 years old) I created some CS-Maps using [Valve Hammer Editor](valve.png), I had some basic knowledge about abstractions, so that help me a lot to understand that "C++ programing" thing, so, I could start creating things with no help. Absolutely alone in my home. After a couple of days I had my own ".exe" file that when you opened it, it asked your name, and then it said "Hello {name}!". That was my first approach to the programming world. My first Hello World. And that was my first second in my bigger passion.

Anecdote: I guess my love for the programming world started the day I say: "What if I create a virus?". I created a program that when you execute it, it remove your `C:/Files Programs/Internet Explorer/iexplorer.exe`. I runned it and it works! And that was not a problem until I get internet in my home (~year 2005) (yeah because I had no Internet Explorer! I had no way to navigate. Obviously I didn't created a backup of `iexplorer.exe`, I was not smart as I should, but, well, it was funny).

More or less in the year 2006 I started participate in some internet forums. One of them was "csadvanced.com" (aka redee.com or wikun.com), there I learned A LOT of a lot of things. I learned about abstractions, logic, about english, about work remotely, and more things. I also learned about AdSense. There I understood that I could get money creating blogs and adding AdSense as a f*ck! And I did it! I created some blogpost about technology news and that was my first attempt, my first approach to HTML and Web-stufs. I learned a lot of SEO and HTML. That was the trigger to start learning PHP. I started learning PHP and VB.net at the same time.

Wow! I just realized that Softonic saved my first VB.net program yet! That was [VIDay](https://viday.softonic.com/)! A software to check ephemerides. I'm super proud about VIDay.

From 2007 to 2010 I was working creating PHP sites and VB.NET programs just for fun. But then, in 2010, I started working on the IT World.
My first work was at [UTN University](http://www.frc.utn.edu.ar/), doing backend in VB.NET and frontend using Vanilla JavaScript and jQuery.

From 2010 to 2015 I always worked in personal (and freelance) projects using always the same technologies (creating and setting up absolutely everything on my own).
* Debian
* SVN
* Apache
* PHP (With no frameworks!)
* Javascript/jQuery as frontend

Then, I left my happy PHP-life (yeah, for real. I love PHP) and I started working using another stack:
* Ubuntu server (setting it up using Vagrant)
* Sometimes SVN, and sometimes GIT
* Apache
* NodeJS + Express + MongoDB
* AngularJS

This stack was super productive for me until 2017, moment where I found React and Firebase. So now, my stack for personal projects has this shape:
* GIT
* Firebase Hosting for static serving
* Firebase Functions and Firebase Database for no-sql database and backend (creating some kind of REST API in Firebase Functions)
* React (+JSX) + Redux + Thunks + Reselect as frontend

^ This is my current Stack. REST API, frontend with React and Backend using Express + NoSQL & Non-Relational-DB (like Mongo). Full ECMAScript stack.

### What I'm looking for?
I want to continue working in JavaScript, I want to code. I prefer frontend, but backend using Express + MongoDB (or non-relational-db) could be a good option.

I want to travel, I want to work and travel at the same time, working remotely, 100% remotely.

If I have to define a perfect week in my perfect work, I would say:
* Working at a USA company, a StartUp (preferably), with people that really love the product we are creating, putting a lot of effort to improve what we are creating. While working, traveling in Europe
* Monday morning sightseeing, lunch and then start working ~2PM (GTM+2) until 10PM (GTM+2).
* Tuesday, I want to spend the whole day free, so I asked to my team if they agree I can take my day free, and they have absolutely no problem about it :)
* Wednesday, working hard, double harder, from 2PM (GTM+2) to 10PM (GTM+2), recovering the free Tuesday.
* Thursday, same as Monday
* Friday, same as Monday, finishing my day ~8PM (GTM+2).
* Saturday and Sunday, if I have something pending to do, I have absolutely no problem to work in weekends. I told you, I love to Code, so work some weekends is not a problem for me (I work all my weekends! Right now is Sunday! 7PM (GTM-3) at a Starbucks in Argentina).

So, summarizing, I want to code in JavaScript, in a solid small team, defining objectives for the week or some kind of Kanban/TODO-list, keeping us in sync by chat and video-calls, working remotely, and flexible (with no hard rules like "You have to be in all our Daily Meetings").

As you can see, this is a "perfect job". Meaning, we can negotiate it.
