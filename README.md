### A bit of my history
I grow up in a really really really little town. Yes, little. Just 800 habitants. Just that.

When I was 14 years old (year 2004), I started working in a "cyber" (those places where you pay for use a computer). That town, in that year, had NO internet, so, I was there, in the cyber, absolutely bored, looking of people went to the cyber to play some games.

After some months working in that cyber, one day I found a book, a really large (horizontal) book with a "roller coaster" in the front. It said something about "C++ programming" (I never found this book again). I opened it, and I read a couple of pages. That day I asked to the owner of that cyber about that book. He told me something like: "It's to learn programming. I'm sure you'll love it. Try it out when you are bored in your home". I was all day long bored in my home! I had no internet! So there I started testing/trying some nice things. I spend like 3 months to understand how to install and run ["Turbo Borland C++ 3.0"](./borland.png).

Due to in ~2000 (~10 years old) I created some CS-Maps using [Valve Hammer Editor](valve.png), I had some basic knowledge about abstractions, so that help me a lot to understand that "C++ programing" thing, so, I could start creating things with no help. Absolutely alone in my home. After a couple of days I had my own ".exe" file that when you opened it, it asked your name, and then it said "Hello {name}!". That was my first approach to the programming world. My first Hello World. And that was my first second in my bigger passion.

Anecdote: I guess my love for the programming world started the day I say: "What if I create a virus?". I created a program that when you execute it, it remove your `C:/Files Programs/Internet Explorer/iexplorer.exe`. I runned it and it works! And that was not a problem until I get internet in my home (~year 2005) (yeah because I had no Internet Explorer! I had no way to navigate. Obviously I didn't created a backup of `iexplorer.exe`, I was not smart as I should, but, well, it was funny).
