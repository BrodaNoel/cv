### A bit of my history
I grow up in a really really really little town. Yes, little. Just 800 habitants. Just that.

When I was 14 years old (year 2004), I started working in a "cyber" (those places where you pay for use a computer). That town, in that year, had NO internet, so, I was there, in the cyber, absolutely boried, looking of people went to the cyber to play some games.

After some months working in that cyber, one day I found a book, a really large (horizontal) book with a "roller coaster" in the front. It said something about "C++ programming" (I never found this book again). I opened it, and I readed a couple of pages. That day I asked to the owner of that cyber about that book. He told me something like: "It's to learn programming. I'm sure you'll love it. Try it out when you are boried in your home". I was all day long boried in my home! I had no internet! So there I started testing/trying some nice things. I spend like 3 months to understand how to install and run ["Turbo Borland C++ 3.0"](https://winworldpc.com/res/img/screenshots/3x-79273d6b68a02608429ca95a942b2223-Turbo%20CPP%203.0%20-%20About.png).
