## A bit of my history
I grow up in a really really really little town. Yes, little. Just 800 habitants. Just that. And the closer city of my town is "Cordoba", 320km far away! That was the `Jan 21, 1990`.

When I was 14 years old (year 2004), I started working in a "cyber" (those places where you pay for use a computer). That town, in that year, had NO internet, so, I was there, in the cyber, absolutely bored, looking of people went to the cyber to play some games.

After some months working in that cyber, one day I found a book, a really large (horizontal) book with a "roller coaster" in the front. It said something about "C++ programming" (I never found this book again). I opened it, and I read a couple of pages. That day I asked to the owner of that cyber about that book. He told me something like: "It's to learn programming. I'm sure you'll love it. Try it out when you are bored in your home". I was all day long bored in my home! I had no internet! So there I started testing/trying some nice things. I spend like 3 months to understand how to install and run ["Turbo Borland C++ 3.0"](./borland.png).

Due to in ~2000 (~10 years old) I created some CS-Maps using [Valve Hammer Editor](valve.png), I had some basic knowledge about abstractions, so that help me a lot to understand that "C++ programing" thing, so, I could start creating things with no help. Absolutely alone in my home. After a couple of days I had my own ".exe" file that when you opened it, it asked your name, and then it said "Hello {name}!". That was my first approach to the programming world. My first Hello World. And that was my first second in my bigger passion.

Anecdote: I guess my love for the programming world started the day I say: "What if I create a virus?". I created a program that when you execute it, it remove your `C:/Files Programs/Internet Explorer/iexplorer.exe`. I runned it and it works! And that was not a problem until I get internet in my home (~year 2005) (yeah because I had no Internet Explorer! I had no way to navigate. Obviously I didn't created a backup of `iexplorer.exe`, I was not smart as I should, but, well, it was funny).

More or less in the year 2006 I started participate in some internet forums. One of them was "csadvanced.com" (aka redee.com or wikun.com), there I learned A LOT of a lot of things. I learned about abstractions, logic, about english, about work remotely, and more things. I also learned about AdSense. There I understood that I could get money creating blogs and adding AdSense as a f*ck! And I did it! I created some blogpost about technology news and that was my first attempt, my first approach to HTML and Web-stufs. I learned a lot of SEO and HTML. That was the trigger to start learning PHP. I started learning PHP and VB.net at the same time.

Wow! I just realized that Softonic saved my first VB.net program yet! That was [VIDay](https://viday.softonic.com/)! A software to check ephemerides. I'm super proud about VIDay.

From 2007 to 2010 I was working creating PHP sites and VB.NET programs just for fun. But then, in 2010, I started working on the IT World.
My first work was at [UTN University](http://www.frc.utn.edu.ar/), doing backend in VB.NET and frontend using Vanilla JavaScript and jQuery.

From 2010 to 2015 I always worked in personal (and freelance) projects using always the same technologies (creating and setting up absolutely everything on my own).
* Debian
* SVN
* Apache
* PHP (With no frameworks!)
* Javascript/jQuery as frontend

Then, I left my happy PHP-life (yeah, for real. I love PHP) and I started working using another stack:
* Ubuntu server (setting it up using Vagrant)
* Sometimes SVN, and sometimes GIT
* Apache
* NodeJS + Express + MongoDB
* AngularJS

This stack was super productive for me until 2017, moment where I found React and Firebase. So now, my stack for personal projects has this shape:
* GIT
* Firebase Hosting for static serving
* Firebase Functions and Firebase Database for no-sql database and backend (creating some kind of REST API in Firebase Functions)
* React (+JSX) + Redux + Thunks + Reselect as frontend

^ This is my current Stack. REST API, frontend with React and Backend using Express + NoSQL & Non-Relational-DB (like Mongo). Full ECMAScript stack.

## What I'm looking for?
I want to continue working in JavaScript, I want to code. I prefer frontend, but backend using Express + MongoDB (or non-relational-db) could be a good option.

I want to travel, I want to work and travel at the same time, working remotely, 100% remotely.

My dream work is in a company from USA, a StartUp (preferably), with people that really love the product we are creating, putting a lot of effort to improve what we are creating. People that really love coding. Traveling while I'm working.
Flexible hours and flexible days. We define objectives in the sprint or the week, and I'll do everything I can do to accomplish them.

As I said, I want to be traveling all the time, not only because I love to live in hostels, meet people and cities, but also because I want and I need to live in non-Spanish countries to learn English. So, I'll be really happy to work in USA for a couple of months (maybe in the company offices) to improve my English.

So, summarizing, I want to code in JavaScript, in a solid small team, with people that love coding (< this is important!), defining objectives for the week/sprint, working remotely, and flexible (with no hard rules like "You have to be in all our Daily Meetings").

As you can see, this is a "perfect job". Meaning, you can offer something that do not full fill this points. We can negotiate it.

## What will I ask in a interview?
* Can you describe your company culture? Which are its more-important-values? Why will I love to work in your company?
* Is your company an StartUp? How many people are working there?
* How many people will have my team?
* The company has the own product, or it's creating software for someone else? B2B?
* How will you measure my performance?
* How is the usual development process? Is there a UI, UX, Researcher, DevOps, etc. teams?
* Which development methodologies are using? Scrum? LEAN?
* Which technologies is using the team where I'll work?
* Which technologies use frontend? And backend?
* Is there a monster? (those ugly-legacy-projects that nobody wants to touch). Will I work on it? Which technologies are using there?
* What kind of tasks will I be working? Bug-fixing? New Features?

## What do I offer?
As you can see I'm looking for a "perfect job", so I have to give you something to let you know that "me" is what you need. This is what I offer:

**One week coding "for free"**. If after that week you feel that I was productive, I added value to your project, I fit with your company culture, and I worth it, you pay me that week, then you define a final $ proposal and let's negotiate about it.

In another hand, if you feel I'm not worth it, **you don't pay me**.
Obviously this free week will help me to see if I really like to work in your company, so it's a win-win.

## How much time I spend coding?
Well... This is something that I really want to highlight.

After my first line of code, I spend my whole life doing it. I just spend a couple of minutes thinking about it, and (proud) I guess after 2008 I spend between 4 and 8 hours per day coding in personal projects. All days. If you add the working hours coding, that number will be insane.

## Which is that project that I would like to see grow up?
Oh yeah! This project has name, and some basic designs. Not published yet, but basically it's a game, a on-off-line game, like [oGame](https://en.ogame.gameforge.com).
I love this kind of games, and I want mine game. I hope to give you more details here ASAP.

## Something more?
* I'm super sociable. My only concern is that sometimes the English block me, but that's an easy win-fix.
* #trekking, #beer, #snowboard, #diving, 
* Music: I love The Smiths, 60ish, 70ish and 80ish, Los Abuelos de la Nada, Cerati and more!
