# Broda Noel - CV

## What I'm looking for?
I want to work and travel at the same time. Work remotely, managing my schedule. So, flexible hours are crucial.

I prefer (but it's not a "must") to work in a small Startup just because there is easier to find the "family feeling" between the people, and between the people and the product/service they are building together.

> Note: I want to continue working in JavaScript. I prefer frontend, but backend using Node could be a good option.

## Glad to work with
* React
* JSX
* Redux
* Flow
* Thunks
* Reselect
* Firebase
* Webpack
* AngularJS (1.x) (no experience in Angular >= 2, but, it could be an option)
* Sass
* Vue (but I have no experience here)

## Languages
* Spanish - Native speaker
* English
  * Writing: I have no problems to chat and keep a written communication. In my last 6 years, I have been working using JIRA and talking by chat to keep my team in sync. (coworkers mainly from NYC and Orlando)
  * Speaking & Listening: When talking about technical stuff, I have no problem, but, I feel like my vocabulary is not big as I would like it to be, so sometimes, in small talks or non-technical-talks, I find myself stuck, but not a big deal.

## A bit of my history
From 2007 to 2010 I was working creating PHP sites and VB.NET programs just for fun. But then, in 2010, I started working on the IT World.
My first work was at [UTN University](http://www.frc.utn.edu.ar/), doing backend in VB.NET and frontend using Vanilla JavaScript and jQuery.

From 2010 to 2015 I always worked in personal (and freelance) projects always using the same technologies (creating and setting up absolutely everything on my own).
* Debian
* SVN
* Apache
* PHP (With no frameworks!)
* Javascript/jQuery as frontend

Then, I left my happy PHP-life and I started working using another stack:
* Ubuntu server (setting it up using Vagrant)
* Sometimes SVN, and sometimes GIT
* Apache
* NodeJS + Express + MongoDB
* AngularJS

This stack was super productive for me until 2017, the moment where I found React and Firebase. So now, my stack for personal projects has this shape:
* GIT
* Firebase Hosting for static serving
* Firebase Functions and Firebase Database for no-sql database and backend (creating some kind of REST API in Firebase Functions)
* React (+JSX) + Redux + Thunks + Reselect as frontend

^ This is my current Stack. REST API, frontend with React and Backend using Express + NoSQL & Non-Relational-DB (like Mongo). Full ECMAScript stack.

## Companies where I worked?
* Home. The best place to improve knowledge randomly. I'm 
working on personal projects to improve knowledge in different technologies.
* CIDS UTN. ~2 years working as .NET developer, doing frontend stuff. (It's kind of software factory, inside a university)
* Loteria de Cordoba. ~2 years working as full stack (SQL, PHP, Vanilla JavaScript). Government company.
* Globant. ~2 years. Huge public software company. Frontend developer (PHP and AngularJS). Working on Disney projects.
* Olapic. ~2 years. Startup. Working as frontend dev (AngularJS and Vanilla JavaScript), working on the Analytics team. (creating dashboards and those stufs). Company currently took over by Monotype.

So, as you can see, I worked at University, Government, Huge public company and Startups.
