_Curriculum Vitae_

### Glad to work with

* Redux
* Thunks
* Reselect
* Firebase
* Webpack
* AngularJS (but, I'm losing this love)
* Sass

### Things that I like, I use in my personal projects, but I'm not sure if I want to work with
#### Because I prefer frontend:
* NodeJS
* MySQL
* MongoDB
* React-Native

#### Because I don't feel confident (yet) to work with:
* Sagas
* GraphQL / Relay

### Languages
* Spanish - Native speaker
* English
  * Writing: I have no problems to chat and keep a written communication. In my last 6 years I have been working using JIRA and talking by chat to keep my team in sync. (coworkers mainly from NYC and Orlando)
  * Speaking & Linstening: When talking about technical stufs, I have no problem, but, I feel like my vocabulary is not big as I would like it to be, so sometimes, in small talks or non-technical-talks, I find myself stuck, but nothing that a cold Beer can not fix :shrug:
