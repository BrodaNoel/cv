# Broda Noel - CV
_Curriculum Vitae_

It's recommended to listen to [this](https://open.spotify.com/user/iam3/playlist/17HYiAIcwlDEg5RgVkm4L7) Spotify playlist while reading this CV :D

## What I'm looking for?
I want to travel, I want to work and travel at the same time, working remotely, 100% remotely.

My dream work is in a StartUp (preferably), with people that really love the product we are creating, putting a lot of effort to improve what we are creating. People that really love coding. Traveling while I'm working.
Flexible hours and flexible days. We define objectives in the sprint or the week, and I'll do everything I can do to accomplish them.

I want to code in JavaScript, in a team with people that love coding (< this is important!), defining objectives for the week/sprint, working remotely, and flexible (with no hard rules like "You have to be in all our Daily Meetings").

As you can see, this is a "perfect job". Meaning, you can offer something that do not full fill this points. We can negotiate it.

> Note: I want to continue working in JavaScript. I prefer frontend, but backend using Express could be a good option.

## Glad to work with
* React
* JSX
* Redux
* Flow
* Thunks
* Reselect
* Firebase
* Webpack
* AngularJS (1.x) (no experience in Angular > 1, but, it could be an option)
* Sass

## Languages
* Spanish - Native speaker
* English
  * Writing: I have no problems to chat and keep a written communication. In my last 6 years I have been working using JIRA and talking by chat to keep my team in sync. (coworkers mainly from NYC and Orlando)
  * Speaking & Listening: When talking about technical stufs, I have no problem, but, I feel like my vocabulary is not big as I would like it to be, so sometimes, in small talks or non-technical-talks, I find myself stuck, but not a big deal.

## A bit of my history
I grow up in a really really really little town. Yes, little. Just 800 habitants. Just that. And the closer city of my town is "Cordoba" (Argentina), 320km far away! That was the `Jan 21, 1990`.

When I was 14 years old (year 2004), I started working in a "cyber" (those places where you pay for use a computer). That town, in that year, had NO internet, so, I was there, in the cyber, absolutely bored, looking of people went to the cyber to play some games.

After some months working in that cyber, one day I found a book, a really large (horizontal) book with a "roller coaster" in the front. It said something about "C++ programming" (I never found this book again). I opened it, and I read a couple of pages. That day I asked to the owner of that cyber about that book. He told me something like: "It's to learn programming. I'm sure you'll love it. Try it out when you are bored in your home". I was all day long bored in my home! I had no internet! So there I started testing/trying some nice things. I spend like 3 months to understand how to install and run ["Turbo Borland C++ 3.0"](./borland.png).

Due to in ~2000 (~10 years old) I created some CS-Maps using [Valve Hammer Editor](valve.png), I had some basic knowledge about abstractions, so that help me a lot to understand that "C++ programing" thing, so, I could start creating things with no help. Absolutely alone in my home. After a couple of days I had my own ".exe" file that when you opened it, it asked your name, and then it said "Hello {name}!". That was my first approach to the programming world. My first Hello World. And that was my first second in my bigger passion.

Anecdote: I guess my love for the programming world started the day I say: "What if I create a virus?". I created a program that when you execute it, it remove your `C:/Files Programs/Internet Explorer/iexplorer.exe`. I runned it and it works! And that was not a problem until I get internet in my home (~year 2005) (yeah because I had no Internet Explorer! I had no way to navigate. Obviously I didn't created a backup of `iexplorer.exe`, I was not smart as I should, but, well, it was funny).

More or less in the year 2006 I started participate in some internet forums. One of them was "csadvanced.com" (aka redee.com or wikun.com), there I learned A LOT of a lot of things. I learned about abstractions, logic, about english, about work remotely, and more things. I also learned about AdSense. There I understood that I could get money creating blogs and adding AdSense as a f*ck! And I did it! I created some blogpost about technology news and that was my first attempt, my first approach to HTML and Web-stufs. I learned a lot of SEO and HTML. That was the trigger to start learning PHP. I started learning PHP and VB.net at the same time.

Wow! I just realized that Softonic saved my first VB.net program yet! That was [VIDay](https://viday.softonic.com/)! A software to check ephemerides. I'm super proud about VIDay.

From 2007 to 2010 I was working creating PHP sites and VB.NET programs just for fun. But then, in 2010, I started working on the IT World.
My first work was at [UTN University](http://www.frc.utn.edu.ar/), doing backend in VB.NET and frontend using Vanilla JavaScript and jQuery.

From 2010 to 2015 I always worked in personal (and freelance) projects using always the same technologies (creating and setting up absolutely everything on my own).
* Debian
* SVN
* Apache
* PHP (With no frameworks!)
* Javascript/jQuery as frontend

Then, I left my happy PHP-life (yeah, for real. I love PHP) and I started working using another stack:
* Ubuntu server (setting it up using Vagrant)
* Sometimes SVN, and sometimes GIT
* Apache
* NodeJS + Express + MongoDB
* AngularJS

This stack was super productive for me until 2017, moment where I found React and Firebase. So now, my stack for personal projects has this shape:
* GIT
* Firebase Hosting for static serving
* Firebase Functions and Firebase Database for no-sql database and backend (creating some kind of REST API in Firebase Functions)
* React (+JSX) + Redux + Thunks + Reselect as frontend

^ This is my current Stack. REST API, frontend with React and Backend using Express + NoSQL & Non-Relational-DB (like Mongo). Full ECMAScript stack.

## Companies where I worked?
* Home. The best place to improve knowledge randomly. I'm always working in personal projects to improve knowledge in different technologies.
* CIDS UTN. ~2 years working as .NET developer, doing frontend stufs. (It's kind of software factory, inside a university)
* Loteria de Cordoba. ~2 years working as full stack (SQL, PHP, Vanilla JavaScript). Government company.
* Globant. ~2 years. Huge public software company. Frontend developer (PHP and AngularJS). Working at Disney projects.
* Olapic. ~2 years (currenlty working here). Startup. Working as frontend dev (AngularJS and Vanilla JavaScript), working in the Analytics team. (creating dashboards and those stufs). Company currently took over by Monotype.

So, as you can see, I worked at University, Government, Huge public company and Startups.

* [Animate5](https://github.com/BrodaNoel/animate5): So ugly code, but so proud. One of my firsts Vanilla Javascript projects. I did it to understand better the Canvas 2D context. Check it out! Open that `index.html` and move that guy!
* Agthy-Site (private): www.agthy.com (the site for React-Agthy project)
* Agthy-Backed (private): The backend code for React-Agthy and Agthy-Site project.
* [DevsEverywhere](https://github.com/BrodaNoel/devseverywhere): Project to learn more about React, Redux, and those yerbas.

* [DevsEverywhere](https://github.com/BrodaNoel/devseverywhere): Just check it out working in www.devseverywhere.com

## Which is that project that I would like to see grow up?
Oh yeah! This project has name, and some basic designs. Not published yet, but basically it's a game, a on-off-line game, like [oGame](https://en.ogame.gameforge.com).
I love this kind of games, and I want my game. I hope to give you more details here ASAP.

## Something more?
* I'm super sociable.
* #trekking, #beer, #snowboard, #diving,
* Music: I love The Smiths, 60ish, 70ish and 80ish.
* I love traveling, a lot.
* Sometimes I take courage and give tech talks ([React + Firebase (hosting & authentication) live demo](firebase.jpg) and [React + Fiber (What's new?) live demo](react-fiber.jpg)).
